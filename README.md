# **Wrapped TON (WTON)**

The Wrapped TON project allows you to use the [FreeTON](http://freeton.org/) native Crystal token on Ethereum.

Wrapped TON works pretty much the same as Wrapped Ether. Minting and burning happens exclusively on the FreeTON network. Anyone can mint WTONs by locking TONs in a special Vault contract. Also anyone can burn WTONs and receive TONs. WTON is supported by the [FreeTON-Ethereum decentralized bridge](http://tonbridge.io/), which allows anyone to convert FreeTON WTONs into Ethereum WTONs at a 1:1 ratio and back.


## 
**How can I wrap my TONs into WTONs?**

It's simple! First of all, you should use the latest FreeTON Crystal wallet ([link](https://l1.broxus.com/freeton/wallet)). Make sure you have the latest version by clicking on the upper-right icon, then "Settings".



1. Open your Crystal wallet and click on the TON section
2. Send as many TONs as you want to the WTON Vault address - [0:136CC9FABCECFA251FAE61A0FA727E1B65FE68EDD2512BEB671582189367FAED](https://ton-explorer.com/accounts/0:136CC9FABCECFA251FAE61A0FA727E1B65FE68EDD2512BEB671582189367FAED).
3. In about a minute the WTON tokens will appear in your Crystal wallet in the quantity of `(amount - fee)`

### 
**Fee**


To wrap TONs into WTONs you have to send at least 1 TON. Otherwise, your TONs will be returned back to you. This 1 TON is used for paying network fees, like the minting tokens fee. Everything that remains unspent from the fee will automatically return to your wallet.


#### 
**Example**

As of 7 Apr 2021, by sending 10 TONs to the Vault, you receive



1. 9 WTON tokens
2. 0.84 TONs back (0.16 spent for fees)

**How can I transfer WTONs from FreeTON to Ethereum?**

1. Open your Crystal wallet and click on the WTON token section
2. Click "Send" and specify the Ethereum address, to which youâ€™d like to send ERC20 WTON tokens. Your Crystal wallet will automatically detect that the Ethereum address was used and create the cross-chain token transfer by using Bridge.
